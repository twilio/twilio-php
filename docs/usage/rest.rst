Using the Twilio REST API
==========================

Since version 3.0, we've introduced an updated API for interacting with the
Twilio REST API. Gone are the days of manual URL creation and XML parsing.

Creating a REST Client
=======================

Before querying the API, you'll need to create a :php:class:`Services_Twilio`
instance. The constructor takes your Twilio Account Sid and Auth
Token (both available through your `Twilio Account Dashboard
<http:www.twilio.com/user/account>`_).

.. code-block:: php

    $ACCOUNT_SID = "AC123";
    $AUTH_TOKEN = "secret";
    $client = new Services_Twilio($ACCOUNT_SID, $AUTH_TOKEN);

The :attr:`account` attribute
-----------------------------

You access the Twilio API resources through this :attr:`$client`,
specifically the :attr:`$account` attribute, which is an instance of
:php:class:`Services_Twilio_Rest_Account`. We'll use the `Calls resource
<http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/call>`_ as an example.

Listing Resources
====================

Iterating over the :attr:`calls` attribute will iterate over all of your call
records, handling paging for you. Only use this when you need to get all your
records.

The :attr:`$call` object is a :php:class:`Services_Twilio_Rest_Call`, which
means you can easily access fields through it's properties. The attribute names
are lowercase and use underscores for sepearators. All the available attributes
are documented in the :doc:`/api/rest` documentation.

.. code-block:: php

    // If you have many calls, this could take a while
    foreach($client->account->calls as $call) {
        print $call->price . '\n';
        print $call->duration . '\n';
    }

Filtering Resources
-------------------

Many Twilio list resources allow for filtering via :php:meth:`getIterator`
which takes an optional array of filter parameters. These parameters correspond
directlty to the listed query string parameters in the REST API documentation.

You can create a filtered iterator like this:

.. code-block:: php

    $filteredCalls = $client->account->calls->getIterator(
        0, 50, array("Status" => "in-progress"));
    foreach($filteredCalls as $call) {
        print $call->price . '\n';
        print $call->duration . '\n';
    }

Retrieving the Total Number of Resources
----------------------------------------

Each of the list resources supports the `Countable` interface, which means you
can retrieve the total number of list items like so:

.. code-block:: php

    echo count($client->account->calls);

Getting a Specific Resource
=============================

If you know the unique identifier for a resource, you can get that resource
using the :php:meth:`get` method on the list resource.

.. code-block:: php

    $call = $client->account->calls->get("CA123");

:php:meth:`get` fetches objects lazily, so it will only load a resource when it
is needed. This allows you to get nested objects without making multiple HTTP
requests.

.. code-block:: php

    $participant = $client->account->conferences
        ->get("CO123")->participants->get("PF123");
