List All Conferences
====================

.. code-block:: php

		$client = new Services_Twilio('AC123', '123');
		foreach ($client->account->conferences as $conference) {
				print $conference->friendly_name;
		}

For a full list of properties available on a conference, as well as a full list
of ways to filter a conference, please see the `Conference API Documentation
<http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/conference>`_ on our website.

Filter Conferences by Status
============================

.. code-block:: php

		$client = new Services_Twilio('AC123', '123');
		foreach ($client->account->conferences->getIterator(0, 50, array(
			'Status' => 'in-progress'
		)) as $conf) {
			print $conf->sid;
		}

Mute all participants
=====================

At the moment, using an iterator directly will cause this method to infinitely
loop. Instead, use the getPage function. As conferences are limited to 40
participants, getPage(0, 50) should return a list of every participant in
a conference.

.. code-block:: php

		$sid = "CO119231312";
		$client = new Services_Twilio('AC123', '123');
		$conference = $client->account->conferences->get($sid);
		$page = $conference->participants->getPage(0, 50);
		$participants = $page->participants;
		foreach ($participants as $p) {
			$p->mute();
		}
