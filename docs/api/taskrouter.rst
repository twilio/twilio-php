All of the below classes inherit from the :php:class:`ListResource
<Services_Twilio_ListResource>`.


Workspaces
====================
.. php:class:: Services_Twilio_Rest_TaskRouter_Workspaces

   For more information, see the Workspaces API Resource https://www.twilio.com/docs/taskrouter/workspaces

      Make a workspace

      :param string $friendlyName: String representing a user-friendly name for the Workspace
      :param array $params: An array of optional parameters for this call

      The **$params** array can contain the following keys:

      *EventCallbackUrl*
		If provided, the Workspace will publish events to this URL. You can use this to gather data for reporting.

      *Template*
		One of the available template names. Will pre-configure this Workspace with the Workflow and Activities specified in the template. “NONE” will create a Workspace with a set of default activities and nothing else. "FIFO" will configure TaskRouter with a set of default activities and a single task queue for first-in, first-out distribution, useful if you want to see a simple TaskRouter configuration when getting started.
