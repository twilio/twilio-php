If you’ve got questions that aren’t answered by this documentation, ask the `#twilio IRC channel <irc://irc.freenode.net/#twilio>`_

Running the Tests
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The unit tests depend on `Mockery <https://github.com/padraic/mockery>`_ and `PHPUnit <https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit>`_. First, 'discover' all the necessary pear channels (which is ridiculous)

.. code-block:: bash

    pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
    pear channel-discover components.ez.no
    pear channel-discover pear.symfony-project.com
    pear channel-discover pear.survivethedeepend.com
    pear channel-discover hamcrest.googlecode.com/svn/pear

.. code-block:: bash

    pear install --alldeps deepend/Mockery
    pear install phpunit/PHPUnit

After installation, run the tests with :data:`make`

.. code-block:: bash

    make test


Making the Documentation
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Our documentation is written using `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_. You'll need to install Sphinx and the Sphinx PHP domain before you can build the docs.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install Sphinx sphinxcontrib-phpdomain

Once you have those installed, making the docs is easy.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd docs
    make html
