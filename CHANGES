twilio-php Changelog
====================

Version 3.2.4
-------------

Released on March 14, 2012

- If no version is passed to the Services_Twilio constructor, the library will
  default to the most recent API version.

Version 3.3.1
-------------

Released on May 1, 2012

- Use the 'Accept-Charset' header to specify we want to receive UTF-8 encoded 
data from the Twilio API. Remove unused XML parsing logic, as the library never 
requests XML data.
